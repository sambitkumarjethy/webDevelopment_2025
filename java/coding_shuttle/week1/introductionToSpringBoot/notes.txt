@SpringBootApplication
________________________

1. It is the starting point of application
2. One application can have only one SpringBootApplication
3. Every thing is a Bean in spring Boot Application


1.5 Spring Boot vs Spring Framework
____________________________________________

1. Starter Dependency → The dependency on Pom.xml.
Auto Configuration → Means will put all the dependency in class and auto configuration.
Example: External Library → springframework.boot:spring-boot-autoconfigure:3.5.4


2. Externalized Configuration
Example: application.properties, Environment Variables


3. Embedded Tomcat Jetty Servers
Example: Dependency listed in Pom.xml file


4. Built-in metrics & Health Checks
Here the dependency version is managed by Spring Boot.
Example: version of MongoDB.


1.6 = Auto Configurations, Application Context and Internal working of a Spring Application.
___________________________________________________________________________

Pom.xml → Maven is a popular build automation tool used in many Java projects. In Spring Boot project, dependencies are specified in pom.xml file.
Maven then also resolves these dependencies and includes them in the classpath.


→ Starter like Spring Boot Starter
Stater (sic) usually include a ton of third-party libraries onto your project by default.
Its Auto Configuration uses these dependencies to setup and pre-config these libraries automatically.

What is Auto Configuration?
_____________________
Auto Configuration refers to the mechanism that automatically configures Spring Boot app based on dependencies present on the
 classpath and other application-specific settings.

This feature simplifies the setup and development process allowing developers to focus more on writing business logic rather than configuring the framework.


Steps How AutoConfiguration Works
_______________________________

(1) Class Path Scanning

Spring Boot scans the classpath for the presence of certain libraries and classes.

Based on what it finds, it applies corresponding configurations.

(2) Configuration Classes

Spring Boot contains numerous auto-configuration classes, each responsible for configuring a specific part of the application.


(3) Conditional Beans


Each auto-configuration class uses conditional checks to decide if it should be applied.

These conditional checks include the presence of specific classes, the absence of user-defined beans, and specific property settings.

In short:

Scan the classpath and find libraries and classes.

Find its corresponding class and suitable auto-configuration class.

Use conditional checks for multiple different features, deciding whether to configure or not.


Core Features of AutoConfiguration
________________________________

(1) @PropertySources Auto-registration

When you run the main method of your Spring Boot Application, SB will automatically register it if the property sources are found.

It creates all beans on application start-up.

(2) META-INF / Spring.factories (Spring Boot)

The AutoConfiguration imports everything.

(3) Every SB project has a dependency on the following library:

    org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure

    This contains a sample list in the file spring.factories, which pretty much auto-configures all of the Spring Boot magic.

    Advanced Conditional Statements Support

    Spring Boot comes with its own set of additional @Conditional annotations, which make developers’ lives easier.

Examples:

@ConditionalOnBean(DataSource.class) → Condition is true only if a DataSource @Bean is in a @Configuration.

@ConditionalOnClass(DataSource.class) → Condition is true if the DataSource class is on the classpath.

@ConditionalOnProperty("my.property") → Condition is true if my.property is set.

So basically, Spring Boot includes a bunch of auto-configurations (classes annotated with @Configuration)
that create @Beans for you if certain @Conditions are met.

Application Context
    |
    |--- IOC Container
             |
             |--- Component Scanning
             |
             |--- Configuration
                     |
                     |--- External Configuration (Properties, YAML)
                     |
                     |--- Conditional Beans
                             |
                             |--- POJO Class
                             |--- Spring Payment
                             |--- Razor Payment



Internal Working of Spring Boot

Flow Diagram Explanation

POJO Classes

StripePayment

RazorpayPayment

These classes go into IOC Container via Component Scanning.

External Configurations (environment variables, property files) are also fed into the IOC Container.

IOC Container then creates the Application Context (bunch of beans).



Step-by-Step Process
________________________

JVM starts and main() method is executed.

SpringApplication.run(MyApp.class, args) is called.

Spring Boot detects:

@SpringBootApplication on MyApp.class, which includes:

@SpringBootConfiguration → Marks as @Configuration.

@ComponentScan → Scans current package & sub-packages.

@EnableAutoConfiguration → Loads auto-configs from spring.factories.

Creates a SpringApplication object:

Sets up ApplicationContext.

Sets up Environment.

Registers Listeners and Initializers.

ApplicationContext is created.

Environment is prepared (e.g., application.properties, args, profiles).

Beans are scanned and registered via @ComponentScan and auto-configured beans are registered (e.g., DataSource, WebServer).

ApplicationContext is refreshed:

All beans are created.

Dependencies are autowired.

Lifecycle methods are called.

Embedded Web Server (e.g., Tomcat) is started.

CommandLineRunner or ApplicationRunner beans (if any) are executed.

Application is now fully started and ready to serve requests.
